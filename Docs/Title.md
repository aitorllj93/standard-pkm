# Title
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

Below the [[Front Matter]] section, I always set a title for the Note. This might look redudant for some Obsidian configurations as it might be the same as the File Name, but it's good to be able to make a separation about those two different things for the following reasons:
* Traditional [[Zettelkasten]] approach uses ids instead of normal file names.
* It's easier to display the title below the banner so it looks better.
* Parsers can extract all the information from a Note by it's content and ignore the file name.
