# Everything is a note
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

(Almost) everything in this repository is a note. Everything you want to remember should be a note so you can reference it and iterate over it in a healthy way. 

Every note tagged with #project/standard-pkm  belongs to the PKM documentation, I recommend you to read all of them at least one time. You can review them and start a discussion with the community if you find something can be improved, but at the same time I would suggest you to try to keep it simple. After you have read the docs, a nice thing to do would be to change the status of them to #status/read or #status/needs-review depending on the case so you can track which part of the docs you missing. To exclude the docs from your Secondary Brain, you can filter your queries by excluding the tag (ie. `-tag:#project/standard-pkm`). If you still feel like there are too many notes related to this, feel free to remove the `Docs` folder inside the repository.
