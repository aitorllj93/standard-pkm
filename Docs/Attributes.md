# Attributes
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

Some specific Note types (see [[Templates]]) can have several attributes (e.g. a [[Reference]] includes the Source and Author attributes). To write attributes on a note I use the following syntax: `Note::Attribute`. This is a format defined on the [Obisdian Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin and I find it's the best approach to follow for now. 

If you feel tempted to use [[Front Matter]] instead, first read [[Use dataview inline fields]].
