# Templates
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

Templates are the building blocks of the Obsidian vault. They try to abstract the different types of notes I plan to take and make it easier to keep a common structure for their content.

## Format

Every template should start with a banner and the note title, and also include the following tags on below the title: `#types/*` and `#status/*`. In this way, we can query the notes in a future by its type and status. Also, every note should be created from a reference in the Journal. In this way, we make sure the note is not an `orphan`, and also we can track the times we thought about that note/idea. For additional fields I follow the fields convention from [Obsidian Dataview Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) for inline fields, which is `Key::Value`, in this way, if the field is a link to a note it will get updated after renamings.

### Research Notes

#### [[Reference]]

Use this template to add a reference to any external content you consume in your creative content. You should write here the extracts from that reference that you liked the most. Remember to **always reference the source when you writing other notes**. Also, try to **include an embed to have a preview of the content**

#### [[Extract]]

Use this template if the [[Reference]] is not enough for managing the extracts. Try to place a single extract on each note in that case.

#### [[Map of Content]]

When you start writing down a bunch of notes you might find some topics repeat a lot. You can turn them into Maps of Contents to place the most useful linked notes into it.


## Legacy

### Format


#### v0

~~Every template should include at least the following fields: `CreatedAt` , `Type`, `Status` and `Tags`. The template fields follow the fields convention from [Obsidian Dataview Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) for inline fields, which is `Key::Value`.~~ All the notes have been migrated to the `v1` format for now, keeping this here just in case I need to readjust them.
