# Prefer links over tags
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

Prefer using [[Links]] over [[Tags]]. Why? Because it's easier to escalate. The benefits about using tags instead of links in Obsidian are as far I know zero. In Obsidian, Links can be used even if the note the link is pointing to is not created, and you get the autocomplete in the same way, then, you can turn those Links into real notes, preferably as a [[Map of Content]]
