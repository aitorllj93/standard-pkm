# Front Matter
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

Frontmatter is an additional rule for [[Markdown]] that was popularised by the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework and used by many others since then. 
Every single Markdown file can have a set of data on the top of the file when it's wrapped with triple slash separators (`---`). The format of this data should be [[YAML]]. You can see an example of the Front Matter by opening any note and clicking on the collapse icon on top of the title. 
In [[Standard PKM]] we use the Front Matter for setting the [[Banner]] configuration, and we plan to keep using it only for internal things such as controlling the way a note is displayed or storing some internal fields we don't want to show on the Note's body.
