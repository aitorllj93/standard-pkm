# Tags
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

A note can have many tags in the format of a hashtag (`#whatever`). [[Standard PKM]] relies on those tags for setting the note's type and status (and optionally a project). Even there's the posibility to include tags everywhere, the ones specified above should be placed below the [[Title]]. This will make easier for parsers to use them by ignoring other tags and also will encourage you to use the least possible tags. You can get more information about why you should not write tags here: [[Prefer links over tags]]
