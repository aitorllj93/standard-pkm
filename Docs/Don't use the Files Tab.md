# Don't use the Files Tab
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

You shouldn't be using the files tab. The folder structure doesn't really matter at all, and thus the reason I decided to keep it simple and just for the need of splitting about the different data the vault can include ([[Notes]], [[Templates]], and [[Media]]). This would also mean it would be easier [[Reading the data with external tools]]. Daily Notes could be an special case as they add too much note and might need to split them from the actual content in a future. Same applies for references as I don't really like about mixing personal data with the others.
