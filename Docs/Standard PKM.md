# Standard PKM
#types/idea  #status/draft  #project/standard-pkm 

[Standard PKM](https://github.com/aitorllj93/standard-pkm) started as personal set of configurations and naming conventions to be able to run a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) in Obsidian by myself in a way that's both simple to use and easy to index/parse. I also tried to minimize the amount of plugins I was using to reduce noise although I ended up with more than I expected. The main inspiration was obviously the [[Zettelkasten]] methodology and some Youtube videos I watched about different implementations in Obsidian and other note-taking apps, you can find the references in the bottom of the document.

The conclusions I ended up having after watching those videos, left me with more doubts than before (specially about the namings), but also with some assertions that I think it would be beneficial to follow in a strict manner. For that reason, I decided to start this #project/standard-pkm  to keep all those rules documented, have a configuration I can reuse and upgrade in a future for any vault I ever need and share them with the community.
