### Hashtags vs Links
[[Links]]:
- topics, concepts, research articles,etc

[[Hashtags]]:
- categories **with intent**
- todos
- When you're writing hashtags you're thinking about yourself searching for this potential thing in the future. **It's not an archive**, because it doesn't have purpose behind it. With this, it has purpose: all individual actionable steps that I might take later or individual concepts that I might take later and compile it into like a proper action document or something.


### Types of Notes:
He talks about the following types in [[Zettelkasten]]:
1. Fleeting Note -> First thing that comes to your mind. Just writing down the Idea and using that scratchpad to think about the Idea. I use the daily note as a fleeting note, to be honest.
2. Literature Note -> Then, the literature note, the literature note is where you're doing some more proper research. I tend to use this for things like research or books or articles. Stuff where I would traditionally study it and take notes. Usually the literature notes are pretty big. **It should be ideally written in your own words.** Literature and Topic Notes. Kindle Highlights. 
3. Practical Notes?: Meetings, People, Projects,
4. Permanent Note. It's the most distilled part of your zettelkasten. It sumarizes a single idea in just a few sentences. Extremely concise. If you had to memorize, this note is the one you want to memorize. Distilled note, not permanent. A high level representation of the mental  models in your brain.
